Simulate a bank account supporting opening/closing, withdrawals, and deposits of money. Ignore the possibility of concurrent transactions!  A bank account can be accessed in multiple ways. Clients can make deposits and withdrawals using the internet, mobile phones, etc. Shops can charge against the account.  It should be possible to close an account; operations against a closed account must fail.  The BankAccount folder contains two files, account.py and test_account.py. In account.py there is a skeleton of the bankAccount class with unimplemented methods and in tests.py there are tests for the methods in the bankAccount class. Challenge today is to implement the methods of the bankAccount class and make all tests pass. Passing the tests is the first step, but goal is to have clean readable code that solves the problem and passes all the tests. Feel free to add more methods and tests.  Raising Exceptions At times it is important to raise exceptions. These come in handy for debugging purposes. This challenge will require you to raise exceptions for operations that should fail.  Note: Create a new repository for the challenge copy over the files from the BankAccount folder to your new repository and happy coding. Ensure you have a detailed readme in the repository.
